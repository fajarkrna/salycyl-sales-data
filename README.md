# Introduction
This repo was a result from my Virual Internship at PT. Kimia Farma, Tbk x Rakamin Academy. As a Big Data Analyst Intern who understands the sales data for each Brand at Kimia Farma, I was assigned to create a dashboard for sales reports in one year from the raw data that has been provided.

# Goals
Designing the data mart from data lake with SQL and visualize it with Google Data Studio

# Process
- Clean the raw data and create a datamart using SQL Server
- Create an aggregated dataset to make analysis process easier
- Create a dashboard based on the datamart

# Tools
- SQLServer
- Looker Studio

# Result
The dashboard was created by Google Data Studio [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/bcc82458-1159-40c0-8652-60b2186b4306) and this is the screen capture for the dashboard:
